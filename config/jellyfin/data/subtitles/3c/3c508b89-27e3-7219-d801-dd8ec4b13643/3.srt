00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,084
<i>Dubai Delivery, this is Kingdom 2-9.</i>

2
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,127
<i>Request clearance to London Heathrow.</i>

3
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,847
Excuse me. Sorry.

4
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,644
<i>Sorry.</i>

5
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,146
Excuse me. Sorry.

6
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,066
- Stop. Stop. Wha--
- I've had a talk with check-in.

7
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,360
They said, "When you get to security,
they'll let you straight through."

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,446
Yes, please. You come.

9
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,032
<i>Kingdom 2-9, good morning.</i>

10
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:18,620
<i>You have a Gulf Air flight ahead of you,
then you are next on the runway 3-0 right.</i>

11
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,789
You sound in good spirits today, Dubai.

12
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,749
It's my birthday today, Kingdom 2-9.

13
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,294
- Well, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Dubai.

14
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,214
If you wanna treat
yourself, try the restaurant at the Plaza.

15
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,426
Yeah, sure. If you wanna
spend your birthday going bankrupt.

16
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,220
I'm serious, Dubai.
Half a lobster for one.

17
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,181
You'll thank me, next time.

18
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,527
Well, a very good morning, everyone.
This is Captain Robin Allen speaking.

19
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,739
On behalf of myself and my first officer,
Anna Kovacs,

20
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,282
- I'd like to welcome you onboard...
- Okay?

21
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:59,286
...this Kingdom Airlines flight
to London Heathrow.

22
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:04,041
<i>Cabin crew today is headed by
the very capable Deevia Khan.</i>

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,002
<i>Deevia and her excellent crew
will be on hand</i>

24
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,922
- for all your questions and concerns.
- Sir, can you sit up, please?

25
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,299
- Flight time today is six hours...
- Good morning, sir.

26
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,383
<i>...54 minutes.</i>

27
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,719
- I think we're down here.
- All right, this side here?

28
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,846
<i>Due to arrive
at London Heathrow round about</i>

29
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,641
<i>six minutes past 1:00
in the afternoon, local time.</i>

30
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,601
<i>Weather en route's calm, clear skies</i>

31
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,561
<i>most of the way, including in the UK.</i>

32
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:29,274
<i>Ground temperature at Heathrow right now
is a mighty seven degrees.</i>

33
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,026
- Just a couple minutes delay...
- Don't say anything.

34
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,195
<i>...while the final few passengers
make their way onboard.</i>

35
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,780
- We should be pushing back...
- Philip!

36
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,907
- See what I can do.
- ...any minute now.

37
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,909
You okay, love? Do you want a pill?

38
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,702
No.

39
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,538
Okay.

40
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,425
Sorry, love.
I'm old-fashioned. Can't help it.

41
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,521
<i>Any remaining passengers</i>

42
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,482
- for flight KA29 to London Heathrow.
- Sorry.

43
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,277
<i>Please make their way to Gate B15.</i>

44
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,445
- Thank you.
- That's any remaining passengers...

45
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,030
Quick as you can, please, sir.

46
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,074
- Right.
- Thank you.

47
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,411
That's great. No hand luggage today?

48
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,497
- No. Just this for my wife.
- Okay. Great.

49
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,916
No, wait! Wait! Wait, please.

50
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,336
No, wait. No, no.

51
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,589
- Sir, the gate is now closed.
- Please.

52
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,965
Sir, I'm sorry.

53
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,801
It's already onboard.
My luggage is already onboard.

54
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,012
- Sir, I'm sorry.
- Please.

55
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,806
Miss, how bad can it be?

56
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,605
Okay.

57
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,149
- Thank you.
- Okay.

58
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,610
Let's go.

59
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,239
Stop! Just stop.

60
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,451
Look, there's a space.
There, David. That's ours.

61
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,370
Stop! You're doing my head in!

62
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,455
You don't get one.

63
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,248
Sorry, love?

64
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,709
The lockers,
it's not like they're allocated.

65
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,377
They all belong to all of us.

66
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,129
We're entitled to 'em
as much as anybody else is.

67
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,839
No, yeah, I know. I'm just saying--

68
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,423
And there's four of us.

69
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,010
It's not just us and our fruity water.

70
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,597
- We've got kids.
- I'm going to tell Mom.

71
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,265
- I hadn't noticed.
- Enough.

72
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,310
Sir, if you'll let me.
There's some space further up the plane.

73
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,437
Thank you.

74
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,654
Right. Just do that.

75
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,367
<i>Well, folks. I'm told we're just
boarding our final few passengers,</i>

76
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,035
<i>and then we'll be on our way.</i>

77
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,912
Morning. Morning.

78
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,748
<i>I'll get back to you a little later
during the flight with any updates.</i>

79
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,959
<i>In the meantime, I will leave you
with Deevia and the team,</i>

80
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,420
and we wish you
a safe and pleasant flight.

81
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,633
Sorry.

82
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,513
- Morning.
- Hi, there. Yeah, just under there.

83
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,599
Hello. Right, just here, on this side.

84
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,320
Hey, by the way, weren't you meant
to be flying transatlantic?

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,905
Wanted to be with my boyfriend.

86
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,700
Is that what they call
sugar daddies these days?

87
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,826
How's your love life, Arthur?

88
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,036
Still drowning in offers,
or have things finally settled down?

89
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,455
- Here. There's room in first.
- Ouch. Okay.

90
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,958
Sir, we're about to push back.

91
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,544
I'm sorry,
but my wife's a rather anxious flier.

92
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,214
We couldn't help notice
a pair of empty seats in business class.

93
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,759
Sir, take it from me,
that's not gonna get you anywhere. Okay?

94
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,636
Back to your seat, please.

95
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,102
I did. Just.

96
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,313
- Right there, sir.
- Thanks.

97
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,029
Make the trade. Yeah. I've got to go.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,335
For a lucky lady?

99
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,754
The other way around. From a lucky man.

100
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,215
- Let me.
- Thank you.

101
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:36,230
Cabin crew, doors to automatic
and cross-check, thank you.

102
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,247
Kingdom 2-9, you're clear for departure
on runway 3-0 right.

103
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,249
<i>Thank you, Dubai. Enjoy your special day.</i>

104
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,917
<i>Don't do anything I wouldn't do.</i>

105
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,335
What does that leave, exactly?

106
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,755
More than a man should admit.

107
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,799
<i>Safe journey now.</i>

108
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,067
<i>In the unlikely event</i>

109
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,528
<i>of the aircraft having to make
an emergency landing,</i>

110
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,989
<i>you'll be told
to adopt the brace position.</i>

111
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,367
<i>If we need to evacuate the aircraft,</i>

112
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,328
<i>please follow the emergency lighting
to your nearest exit,</i>

113
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,038
<i>taking nothing with you.</i>

114
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,333
{\an8}<i>Your cabin crew
will now point out your nearest exits.</i>

115
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,544
<i>Slides will deploy</i>

116
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,629
<i>from these emergency exits.</i>

117
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,340
<i>If the aircraft lands on water,</i>

118
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,677
<i>life jackets are beside
or underneath your seat.</i>

119
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,222
<i>Place them over your head,
and tie them securely, like so.</i>

120
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,310
<i>These should not be inflated
until you exit the aircraft.</i>

121
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,981
<i>During the flight, all devices
should remain in flight-safe mode.</i>

122
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,899
Hey.

123
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,275
<i>During takeoff and landing...</i>

124
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,359
Hey.

125
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,196
Can you turn that down?

126
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,532
Please.

127
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,701
<i>Your luggage should be stowed
in the overhead lockers</i>

128
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,369
<i>or under the seat in front.</i>

129
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,455
<i>Now, please. Sit back,
switch off and stow...</i>

130
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,539
Thanks.

131
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:22,169
<i>...your electronic devices and prepare for
a relaxing flight with Kingdom Airlines.</i>

132
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,590
Cabin crew,
please take your seats for takeoff.

133
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,041
{\an8}<i>Stabilize. V1.</i>

134
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,797
{\an8}This is us. Look.

135
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:35,302
{\an8}We go all the way up here,
right over Europe.

136
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,263
This thing shaped like a boot is...

137
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:42,017
I-- It-- It's Italy.

138
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:46,563
{\an8}Then we carry on across this bit,
and where's that, Fred?

139
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,524
Can I play Mario Kart now?

140
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:49,733
That's home!

141
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,153
{\an8}Seven hours all that way,
that's all it takes.

142
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:57,991
Yeah, in a bit.

143
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,336
Do you know the internationally accepted
code for caffeine?

144
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,509
Once for seat belts, twice for coffee.

145
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,852
How does he take it?

146
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,020
Why are you asking me?

147
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,906
- Like I said, I'm old-fashioned like that.
- Thanks.

148
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,537
When do they come round
with the champagne?

149
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,627
We got off on the wrong foot.

150
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,673
Hugo. Marketing.

151
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,885
UK start-ups in the UAE,
it's actually a very interesting area.

152
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,013
What about you?

153
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,310
Let me guess. Banker. No, properties.

154
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,478
Sport, maybe?

155
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,648
One of those agents who makes
a disgusting amount of cash.

156
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,108
Enjoy the movie.

157
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,110
Movie?

158
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,947
Or whatever it is you're gonna do
that doesn't involve speaking to me.

159
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,201
Okay.

160
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,288
Fine.

161
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:57,986
Flight deck.

162
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,072
<i>Hey, it's Arthur. Got your coffee.</i>

163
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,156
Thanks.

164
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,917
Hey, guys.

165
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,773
Listen to R & B I suppose, but...

166
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,736
What?

167
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,827
Is that...

168
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:48,829
I don't know.

169
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,585
You all right, darling?

170
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,423
I found something.

171
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,052
Is it real?

172
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,305
You're asking the wrong man.

173
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,391
What do I do?

174
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,813
Okay, I'll go tell someone.

175
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,649
Somebody in the crew, they'll have
a whatsit, a thing they do.

176
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,235
- A procedure.
- That's right.

177
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,570
Want me to come with you?

178
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,572
- Do you want to?
- I can come.

179
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,701
Maybe we should wait.

180
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,786
Keep it low-key, yeah?

181
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:31,997
What's your name, darling?

182
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,417
- Naomi.
- I'm Marcus.

183
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,836
You stay there, Naomi.

184
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,963
I'll be straight back,
tell you what they said.

185
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,153
<i>Morning, ladies and gentlemen.
We have now reached our cruising altitude.</i>

186
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,781
<i>Our in-flight refreshment service
will commence shortly with drinks,</i>

187
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:09,368
<i>followed later in the flight by lunch,
prior to our landing in London.</i>

188
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,036
Everything okay, sir?

189
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,332
I need a very quick word, please.

190
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,045
A very quick word with my nephew.

191
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,840
Sorry,
you're not actually allowed in first.

192
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,299
One minute and I'll be gone.

193
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,344
Thank you, darling.

194
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,097
Sir, wait. You're not allowed in...

195
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:31,974
Sir.

196
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,436
Problem.

197
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,902
One of our lot left a round in the toilet,
and some girl found it.

198
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,032
We bring it forward.

199
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,618
That's my call.

200
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:56,164
Yeah. That's why I'm here,
to advise you to make the call.

201
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,375
The plan was three hours.

202
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,252
Plan's gone to shit.

203
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,380
They think I'm up here
reporting it to the staff.

204
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:04,882
Cabin crew.

205
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:12,347
Right. Well, go back
and you tell them you reported it.

206
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,392
And you tell them they said
it wasn't a problem.

207
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,768
How's that not a problem?

208
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,356
Because, Terry, it belonged to someone
who's allowed to have it.

209
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,026
Like a soldier or something like that.

210
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,820
And if they don't buy it?

211
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,162
That's the five-minute warning.

212
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,501
Go out the back wearing that and make sure
every one of our lot sees you.

213
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,214
And whatever you tell the girls,
it's only gotta hold for five minutes.

214
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,842
We go on Jamie's call like we practiced.

215
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,396
- Thank you, darling.
- No problem.

216
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,426
Long story short, we're okay.

217
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:35,514
Turns out there was some sort of
routine security check before takeoff.

218
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,099
Happens about once a week, apparently.

219
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,685
And one who was on board,
one of the Dubai security boys,

220
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,144
asked to use the toilet.

221
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,146
- And that's how it got there?
- Yeah.

222
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,316
They're all armed, see.
Foreign police. It's not like London.

223
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,901
So they weren't worried?

224
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,572
Didn't seem to be.
Not like the four of us, hey?

225
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,241
I told them that and all.
I said we'd had a moment.

226
00:17:56,827 --> 00:18:03,208
One thing she did ask more seriously
was for us not to repeat any of this

227
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,668
in case it causes any...

228
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:07,045
Concern. No, of course.

229
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,675
So, wait, some guy gets on the plane.

230
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,969
He's got some sort of gun.

231
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,723
He goes to the toilet,
and that's how it got there?

232
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,684
It just fell out?
That's what you're saying?

233
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:23,270
- No, darling, that's what they're saying.
- Mona.

234
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,188
I don't get it.

235
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:30,903
Listen, I went up there, I told them.
That's what they told me.

236
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,280
And they didn't seem worried.

237
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,282
- But--
- That's the point.

238
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,120
That's the important thing.

239
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,833
Thank you, Marcus. Honestly.

240
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,090
- You all right?
- Yeah.

241
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:18,909
Why would they lie?

242
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,244
That's not what I'm saying.

243
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,789
I just want them to explain.

244
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,458
No. No, Mona.

245
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:30,212
Think about it. You can't
just bring bullets on to a plane.

246
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,382
Next, please.

247
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,313
Senil?

248
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,024
<i>They want you to come home.</i>

249
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:55,487
<i>Tell your boss you're not feeling well
and come home right now.</i>

250
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,155
What for?

251
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,407
<i>Gala!</i>

252
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,491
What for Senil?

253
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,931
He is allowed to play.

254
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:26,143
- Did I say anything?
- Just like she's allowed to watch a film

255
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,854
- and him and all of those other--
- Yeah. They're on headphones.

256
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,147
He would be on his headphones,

257
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,858
but the headphones that fits his game
are in his suitcase.

258
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,777
There was no room for that, remember?
Because of all your bags.

259
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,571
- All my bags?
- Yeah, you went shopping.

260
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,989
One thing.

261
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,991
Which you put in our locker.

262
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,620
You know what, I'm not saying anything.
I'm not having this conversation.

263
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,622
You started the conversation, love.

264
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,249
- No, I'm saying nothing.
- Yeah, you don't sound like it.

265
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:52,878
What are you doing?

266
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:37,673
Hi.

267
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,466
You know how you said that
that thing in the toilets

268
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,801
was nothing to worry about, yeah?

269
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,053
Excuse me?

270
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,722
The object in the toilet.

271
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:47,891
The item.

272
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,061
- Item?
- It might not have been him that he told.

273
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,272
And you said
there was nothing to worry about?

274
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,747
Start from the beginning for me.

275
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,584
Nice and slow, okay?
What was the item that you found?

276
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,711
You want me to say it?

277
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:20,007
- It might help.
- You want me to say it out loud?

278
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,217
Unless you wanna draw me a picture. Yeah.

279
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,385
Wow.

280
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,599
How can I help, sir?

281
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,393
Sorry, yeah, I didn't get a washbag.

282
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,396
Well, you don't get a washbag.
Only on the overnight flights.

283
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:37,482
- So no one's got a washbag?
- No.

284
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:41,195
Thanks.

285
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,201
Sir?

286
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,708
He said not to do this.

287
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,627
She's just thinking about
health and safety.

288
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:57,961
Look, what did you find?

289
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:00,797
Look, madam, if you think it's important,
you need to tell me what it is.

290
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,090
Don't.

291
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:06,053
Thing is,
we don't want people to, you know...

292
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:08,597
- What?
- Panic.

293
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,701
Everybody down!

294
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,746
Down! Down!

295
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,624
- Remain in your seats!
- You! Down!

296
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:38,210
Get down! All of you! Get down now!

297
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,506
Do not move!

298
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,050
Sit the fuck down!

299
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,844
Stay in your fucking seats!

300
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,136
Oh, geez.

301
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,056
- Do not move!
- Stay the fuck down!

302
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,349
Don't be fucking stupid!

303
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,392
Please!

304
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,064
Stay calm! Sit down. Face the front.

305
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,026
No, you fucking don't.

306
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,780
Everyone stay calm,
and no one gets hurt, okay?

307
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,505
Morning.

308
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,469
Kai, do you want some milk?

309
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:40,355
Morning.

310
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,199
Wow.

311
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:55,204
So Detective Daniel gets
to sleep over now.

312
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,455
You don't call him that, Kai.

313
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:59,583
So, what are we? Are we all flatmates now?

314
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,876
We spoke about this.

315
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,545
It's okay. I get it.

316
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:06,215
Great bike, by the way.

317
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,594
Thanks. I decided to get one
that's fixed onto the floor.

318
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:12,471
Go on.

319
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:15,307
So that you and your mates
can't pull me over for no reason.

320
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,643
That's a good joke. I like it.

321
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,228
- No joke.
- Kai.

322
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,771
And you don't like it.

323
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:32,199
Everybody, listen!
This is how it's gonna work.

324
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,619
Nobody makes any noise.

325
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:38,914
Nobody makes any trouble.

326
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:45,838
And nobody gets seriously fucking injured.

327
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,551
Did you hear that? That's Arabic.

328
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:55,055
- She's speaking English.
- She is. She's English.

329
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,184
But someone is speaking Arabic.

330
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:06,191
Phones, tablets, devices. The Wi-Fi's off.
There's no need to be a hero.

331
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,824
Hey, what's your name?

332
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,410
- Amanda. Yeah.
- Amanda?

333
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,579
Amanda, just breathe, all right? I'm Sam.

334
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,665
- Listen to me. Drink that.
- Okay.

335
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,210
Look, you're like me, yeah?

336
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,171
Got family? Loved ones?

337
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,465
We got one job to do right now.

338
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:33,260
- Just get through it for them. All right?
- Back in your fucking seat.

339
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,053
Yeah.

340
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:44,521
Well, I can't see anything.
Explains why no one's answering.

341
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,691
I'm sure I heard something.
Try calling the other galleys.

342
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:06,126
Oh, come on. What difference does it make?

343
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,092
Oh, mate, it's all right. It's--

344
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,058
Listen, we've got an incident.

345
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:22,309
<i>We've got a major incident--</i>

346
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,228
Wait. Slow down.
I can't hear what you're saying.

347
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:27,022
They've got control of the whole plane.
They've--

348
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:37,074
They've got guns.

349
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,668
Colette Fisher.

350
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:55,676
Dubai, this is Kingdom 2-9.
Dubai, can you hear me?

351
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,678
Kingdom 2-9, you can't keep away.

352
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:01,849
<i>Dubai, we have a possible
security incident on board. Stand by.</i>

353
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,769
Whatever's happening out there.
We cannot open that door.

354
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,192
Correction, Dubai. That's a definite
security incident on board.

355
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,570
Definite security incident on board.

356
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,947
We all know the score.

357
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:20,909
If they're Arab or anything like that,
we take 'em on, yeah?

358
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,120
We've got no choice.

359
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,538
That's not a good idea.

360
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:30,627
You wanna let them crash us
into some capital city, is that it?

361
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,921
Oh, come on.
Is that what you think's gonna happen?

362
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:34,464
I have no idea, pal.

363
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,757
No. Obviously.

364
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:38,135
Yeah, but I'm not gonna wait
and find out, am I?

365
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,639
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna just attack him?

366
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,641
No one's asking you to join in.

367
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,185
You'll get yourself killed.

368
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:49,104
Listen, if you've not got the balls,

369
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,816
- all you have to do is say.
- Phones, tablets, devices.

370
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:53,901
Come on.

371
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:56,778
Thank you.

372
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,489
Phone?

373
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:03,243
I haven't got it. Listen, you can have it.

374
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,787
It's just, it's in my seat,
and this isn't my seat.

375
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,581
She put me in this seat, remember?

376
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:34,149
- Okay, now. Let's go.
- We're doing this.

377
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,780
Listen. Listen, guys.

378
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:43,784
No one is asking you to make this call.
No one. All right?

379
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:45,994
Just because you speak the loudest

380
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,538
doesn't mean you've got
anything better to say.

381
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:48,830
It doesn't mean
you've thought this through.

382
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,999
- There's nothing to think through.
- No, there is.

383
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,544
You just haven't thought of it yet.
All right?

384
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,713
Look, this plane took off from Dubai,

385
00:29:56,713 --> 00:30:00,467
so there are people on this flight
that only speak Arabic.

386
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,844
So, if you're gonna hijack a plane,

387
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:04,555
- Arabic's a language you need to speak.
- Handheld devices.

388
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:12,521
It doesn't make you a suicide bomber.
It just means you're prepared.

389
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:16,775
Phones. Tablets.

390
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:19,695
Devices.

391
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,614
The Wi-Fi is off...

392
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,910
so no need to be a hero.

393
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:35,419
Until you know who these people are,
do nothing.

394
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:45,512
It's not gonna work.

395
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,056
They won't let you in.
Not if something's happening.

396
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,308
That's right.

397
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:51,435
That's the rule.

398
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,770
That's right.
That's why you're gonna convince 'em.

399
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,078
Flight deck.

400
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,416
<i>They want access to the cockpit.</i>

401
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,211
That's not possible.

402
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:24,134
<i>I know that, but they've got guns,
and they're not giving up.</i>

403
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,137
No, we understand that.
We understand that,

404
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:30,098
but that's why we can't open the door.
You know that.

405
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,894
- She's saying no.
- She?

406
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,313
- First officer.
- Talk to the pilot.

407
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:39,233
- He'll say the same thing.
- The pilot. Now.

408
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,826
<i>I need to speak to the captain.</i>

409
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,883
Captain speaking.

410
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:09,137
<i>They want access to the cockpit.</i>

411
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:12,099
You know we can't do that.

412
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,434
I know that. I've said that.

413
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,856
Talk to him about last night,
about what it meant to you.

414
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:20,732
The Plaza.

415
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,735
How do you know about that?

416
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:28,323
Say it was magical.
Say every trip to Dubai is magical.

417
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,368
- Robin.
- 'Cause you get to be together.

418
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,121
Because you love him.

419
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:35,789
Robin.

420
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,499
Tell him you love him.

421
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:39,960
Robbie, they know.

422
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:43,714
Say it!

423
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,181
<i>Love you.</i>

424
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,100
<i>I love you.</i>

425
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,275
I love you too, Colette.

426
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,823
Either he opens that door,
or I pull this trigger.

427
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,461
He's gonna kill me.
Please, just open the door.

428
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,380
<i>He's gonna blow my head off. Please.</i>

429
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,439
If it doesn't open, we kill this one
and do another one and so on, yeah?

430
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,613
If they take control of this plane,

431
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,367
they can fly it anywhere,
do anything with it.

432
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,509
No. You--

433
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,511
- Robin.
- I don't want to fight you.

434
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:15,681
Don't make me fight you.
I don't want to fight you.

435
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:20,185
- No!
- Anna. Anna, s-- Anna, stop!

436
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:25,357
Stop. Listen to me. Listen to me.
I'm going to open that door, okay?

437
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:27,317
If you try to stop me, I will hurt you.

438
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,735
You fight me, I will fight you,
and I will win.

439
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:34,199
Whatever happens,
whatever you think of me,

440
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,701
I'm opening that door.

441
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:42,748
No.

442
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:48,839
No! Stop!

443
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:59,683
Oh, my God.

444
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:14,323
<i>Kingdom 2-9 is a British A330</i>

445
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:16,074
<i>now entering the Bahraini airspace.</i>

446
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:19,703
We'll have contact with it
for another 20 minutes, maximum.

447
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,873
<i>Dubai, this is Kingdom 2-9. Do you copy?</i>

448
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,709
Kingdom 2-9, go ahead.

449
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:30,255
<i>Dubai, I can report
the incident has now been resolved.</i>

450
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:31,798
Resolved?

451
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:36,303
<i>That is correct. I'm happy
to say the entire thing was a false alarm.</i>

452
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,096
<i>We're sorry for any anxiety.</i>

453
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,849
Kingdom 2-9,
you said you had a definite incident.

454
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,103
"Definite security incident on board."
How is that a false alarm?

455
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:52,069
It turns out there was a--

456
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:54,279
It was just a couple of drunken passengers

457
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,781
trying to make a sick joke.

458
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:58,909
We'll be notifying Heathrow
to make sure the police are there

459
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:00,452
<i>to question them on arrival.</i>

460
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,828
We can do that for you.

461
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,414
- Negative, Dubai.
- It's no problem.

462
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,333
Thank you, Dubai,

463
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,794
but I think we've wasted enough
of your time already.

464
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,884
In that case,
you're now leaving our airspace.

465
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:18,011
We wish you a safe onward journey.

466
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,014
Kingdom 2-9, copy.

467
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:27,855
Good. Now turn off the Wi-Fi.

468
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:46,373
They said there's no Wi-Fi.

469
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:52,296
If there's no Wi-Fi,
then why take everyone's phones?

470
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:08,061
This is a 300. I usually fly the 200s.

471
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:28,749
There.

472
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,384
Here, look.

473
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:46,892
You did that.

474
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:19,424
You're disappointed?

475
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:24,680
No, I'm relieved.

476
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:28,600
Now you have to do all the paperwork too.

477
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,436
For the plane that cried wolf.

478
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:15,606
Senil?

479
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:21,486
Gala?

480
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,366
Senil?

481
00:39:57,606 --> 00:40:00,067
It's just gonna take a bit of time.
That's all.

482
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:04,112
Well, you've been saying that for months.
What does he expect?

483
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,159
I'm sorry. Not helpful.

484
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:11,870
You ready for your interview?

485
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:15,123
I think so.

486
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,210
You're gonna be great. It's gonna be fine.

487
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,671
You're gonna have an amazing day.

488
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,442
What is it?

489
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,120
<i>"This is your cabin crew speaking.</i>

490
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:56,665
<i>This flight is now under the complete,</i>

491
00:40:56,665 --> 00:41:00,043
<i>and irreversible control
of those who have taken charge.</i>

492
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,381
<i>All means of communication
with the ground has been severed.</i>

493
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:09,052
<i>Nobody outside of this aircraft
is aware of any issues on board.</i>

494
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:14,016
<i>The captain and cabin crew have decided</i>

495
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:18,437
<i>full cooperation is the best
and only way forward.</i>

496
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:21,064
<i>If--</i>

497
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:24,818
<i>If you stay calm,</i>

498

<i>stay in your allocated seats,

499
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:32,993
<i>there is nothing to stop this flight
continuing exactly as it normally would.</i>

500
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:37,039
Resist, however, and--

501
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:44,922
Resist, however, and not only
will you be severely punished,

502
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:49,968
<i>but so too will other innocent passengers
chosen at random</i>

503
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:52,387
<i>as an example to the rest of the plane."</i>

504
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:56,016
Take it from me.
That's not gonna get you anywhere.

505
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:59,019
<i>"Ladies and gentlemen,
this flight is now six hours from London.</i>

506
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:02,064
{\an8}<i>Six hours and this will all be over."</i>

507
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:08,612
I told him. We spoke about it.
I told him not to get on the plane.

508
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:12,241
Dad wouldn't lie
about something like this.

509
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:18,705
All right. So, he's on a flight
back from Dubai, yeah?

510
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:20,457
You got a flight number?

511
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:21,792
No.

512
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:25,045
But Mum will.

513
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:28,799
They'll probably want everything
you have, every detail. Okay?

514
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:31,343
- What does the message say?
- Kai.

515
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:32,928
It's important.

516
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,308
Dad says, "I'm flying back.

517
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,811
I need to come back to London
for work meetings."

518
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,604
Mom says, "Stop playing games."

519
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:44,398
Dad says, "I take off at 9:12."

520
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,775
Mom says, "Do not get on that plane."

521
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:51,864
Then, an hour ago, Dad says, "Too late."

522
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:58,871
Then Dad says,
"Incident on board. Serious.

523
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:02,541
But I'll get home. I love you."

524
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,253
"I always will."

525
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:24,354
- Get back!
- It's okay.

526
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:27,107
I'm just doing as she said,
going back to my allocated seat.

527
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:28,650
Sit the fuck down!

528
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,862
- Stop! What are you doing?
- I'm just getting my phone.

529
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:35,282
Right, I promised you
I'd give you my phone, and here it is.

530
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:42,873
What, you come up here just for that?

531
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,044
And to make you an offer.

532
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:51,256
What exactly does your dad do
for a living?

533
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,302
It's difficult to explain.

534
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:59,932
He gets brought in by big companies.

535
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:02,726
If there's a merger or takeover,
it doesn't matter where,

536
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,895
they bring Sam in
at the end of the process,

537
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:06,438
'cause when it all kicks off...

538
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,317
Sam's the best at handling it.

539
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:11,985
Handling what?

540
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:17,574
The negotiation.

541
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,413
Now, listen to me, all right?

542
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:26,542
There are, like,
some 200 people on this flight,

543
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,002
and most of them will do
exactly as you say.

544
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,587
- That's right.
- But, let's face it,

545
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:33,257
there are some who will kick off
and who'll cause you problems.

546
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:34,675
- Sit down.
- No, no.

547
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:36,635
Let me just tell you where I'm at, okay?

548
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,724
Let me tell you where I'm at with this,
all right?

549
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:47,145
I don't care about any of those people.
I just wanna get home to my family.

550
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:49,481
So here's what I'm gonna do.

551
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:53,819
I'm gonna help you.
