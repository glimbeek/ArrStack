00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,906
- Like I said, I'm old-fashioned like that.
- Thanks.

171
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,036
When do they come round
with the champagne?

172
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:43,954
[chuckles]

173
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,627
We got off on the wrong foot.

174
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,673
Hugo. Marketing.

175
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,885
UK start-ups in the UAE,
it's actually a very interesting area.

176
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,013
What about you?

177
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,310
Let me guess. Banker. No, properties.

178
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,478
Sport, maybe?

179
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,648
One of those agents who makes
a disgusting amount of cash.

180
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,108
Enjoy the movie.

181
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,110
Movie?

182
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,947
Or whatever it is you're gonna do
that doesn't involve speaking to me.

183
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,659
Okay. [scoffs]

184
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,288
Fine.

185
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,986
- [phone ringing]
- [Anna] Flight deck.

186
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,072
<i>Hey, it's Arthur. Got your coffee.</i>

187
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,156
Thanks.

188
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,917
Hey, guys.

189
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,265
[passengers chattering]

190
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,811
[both chuckle]

191
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,858
Listen to R & B I suppose, but...
[speaks indistinctly]

192
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,234
[both chuckling]

193
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,736
What?

194
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,827
Is that...

195
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:48,829
I don't know.

196
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,585
You all right, darling?

197
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,423
[whispering] I found something.

198
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,052
Is it real?

199
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,305
You're asking the wrong man.

200
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,391
[passenger] What do I do?

201
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,813
[stammers] Okay, I'll go tell someone.

202
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,649
Somebody in the crew, they'll have
a-- a whatsit, a thing they do.

203
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,235
- [stammers] A procedure.
- That's right.

204
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,570
Want me to come with you?

205
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,572
- Do you want to?
- I can come.

206
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,910
Maybe we should wait. [sighs]

207
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,786
Keep it low-key, yeah?

208
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:31,997
What's your name, darling?

209
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,417
- Naomi.
- I'm Marcus.

210
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,836
You stay there, Naomi.

211
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,963
I'll be straight back,
tell you what they said.

212
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,221
[sighs]

213
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,816
[intercom chimes]

214
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,153
[Arthur] Morning, ladies and gentlemen.
We have now reached our cruising altitude.

215
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,781
<i>Our in-flight refreshment service
will commence shortly with drinks,</i>

216
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:09,368
<i>followed later in the flight by lunch,
prior to our landing in London.</i>

217
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,036
Everything okay, sir?

218
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,332
I need a very quick word, please.

219
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,045
A very quick word with my nephew.

220
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,840
Um, sorry,
you're not actually allowed in first.

221
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,299
One minute and I'll be gone.

222
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,260
[stammers, sighs]

223
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,344
Thank you, darling.

224
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,097
[Deevia] Sir, wait. You're not allowed in...

225
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:31,974
Sir.

226
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,436
[Marcus] Problem.

227
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,902
One of our lot left a round in the toilet,
and some girl found it.

228
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,032
We bring it forward.

229
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,618
That's my call.

230
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:56,164
Yeah. That's why I'm here,
to advise you to make the call.

231
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,375
The plan was three hours.

232
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,252
Plan's gone to shit.

233
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,380
They think I'm up here
reporting it to the staff.

234
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:04,882
Cabin crew.

235
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:12,347
Right. Well, go back
and you tell them you reported it.

236
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,392
And you tell them they said
it wasn't a problem.

237
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,768
How's that not a problem?

238
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,356
Because, Terry, it belonged to someone
who's allowed to have it.

239
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,026
Like a soldier or something like that.

240
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,820
And if they don't buy it?

241
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,162
That's the five-minute warning.

242
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,501
Go out the back wearing that and make sure
every one of our lot sees you.

243
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,214
And whatever you tell the girls,
it's only gotta hold for five minutes.

244
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,842
We go on Jamie's call like we practiced.

245
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,396
- [Terry] Thank you, darling.
- [Deevia] No problem.

246
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,000
[passengers chattering]

247
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,426
Long story short, we're okay.

248
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:35,514
Turns out there was some sort of
routine security check before takeoff.

249
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,099
Happens about once a week, apparently.

250
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,685
And one who was on board,
one of the Dubai security boys,

251
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,144
asked to use the toilet.

252
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,146
- [Naomi] And that's how it got there?
- [Terry] Yeah.

253
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,316
They're all armed, see.
Foreign police. It's not like London.

254
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,901
So they weren't worried?

255
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,572
Didn't seem to be.
Not like the four of us, hey?

256
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,241
I told them that and all.
I said we'd had a moment.

257
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,325
[all chuckle]

258
00:17:56,827 --> 00:18:03,208
One thing she did ask more seriously
was for us not to repeat any of this

259
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,668
in case it causes any...

260
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:07,045
Concern. No, of course.

261
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,675
So, wait, some guy gets on the plane.

262
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,969
He's got some sort of... [whispers] ...gun.

263
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,723
He goes to the toilet,
and that's how it got there?

264
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,684
It just fell out?
That's what you're saying?

265
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:23,270
- No, darling, that's what they're saying.
- Mona.

266
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,188
I don't get it.

267
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:30,903
Listen, I went up there, I told them.
That's what they told me.

268
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,280
And they didn't seem worried.

269
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,282
- But--
- [Terry] That's the point.

270
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,120
That's the important thing.

271
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,833
Thank you, Marcus. Honestly.

272
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,090
- You all right?
- Yeah.

273
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:18,909
[Naomi] Why would they lie?

274
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,244
That's not what I'm saying.

275
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,789
I just want them to explain.

276
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,959
- No. No, Mona.
- [chimes]

277
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:30,212
Think about it. You can't
just bring bullets on to a plane.

278
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,382
[guard] Next, please.

279
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,847
- [scanner beeps]
- [cell phone buzzing]

280
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,313
Senil?

281
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,024
[Senil, in Malayalam]
They want you to come home.

282
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:55,487
<i>Tell your boss you're not feeling well
and come home right now.</i>

283
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,155
[in Malayalam] What for?

284
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,407
[Senil] Gala!

285
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,491
What for Senil?

286
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:02,995
[inhales sharply]

287
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,257
[tablet chiming]

288
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,931
[in English] He is allowed to play.

289
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:26,143
- [passenger] Did I say anything?
- Just like she's allowed to watch a film

290
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,854
- and him and all of those other--
- Yeah. They're on headphones.

291
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,147
He would be on his headphones,

292
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,858
but the headphones that fits his game
are in his suitcase.

293
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,777
There was no room for that, remember?
Because of all your bags.

294
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,571
- All my bags?
- Yeah, you went shopping.

295
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,989
[scoffs] One thing.

296
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,991
Which you put in our locker.

297
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,159
[stammers, chuckling]

298
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,620
You know what, I'm not saying anything.
I'm not having this conversation.

299
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,622
You started the conversation, love.

300
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,249
- No, I'm saying nothing.
- Yeah, you don't sound like it.

301
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:52,878
[mouthing words] What are you doing?

302
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,333
[passengers chattering]

303
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:37,673
Hi.

304
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,466
You know how you said that
that thing in the toilets

305
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,801
was nothing to worry about, yeah?

306
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,053
E-Excuse me?

307
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,722
The object in the toilet.

308
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:47,891
The item.

309
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,061
- [Arthur] Item?
- It might not have been him that he told.

310
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,272
[Mona] And you said
there was nothing to worry about?

311
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,747
Start from the beginning for me.

312
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,584
Nice and slow, okay?
What was the item that you found?

313
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,711
You want me to say it?

314
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:20,007
- It might help.
- [Mona] You want me to say it out loud?

315
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,217
Unless you wanna draw me a picture. Yeah.

316
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,385
Wow.

317
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,599
How can I help, sir?

318
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,393
Sorry, yeah, I, um, didn't get a washbag.

319
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,396
Well, you don't get a washbag.
Only on the overnight flights.

320
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:37,482
- So no one's got a washbag?
- Mmm. No.

321
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,567
Hmm.

322
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:41,195
Thanks.

323
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,201
Sir?

324
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,708
He said not to do this.

325
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,627
She's just thinking about
health and safety.

326
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:57,961
Look, what did you find?

327
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:00,797
Look, madam, if you think it's important,
you need to tell me what it is.

328
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,090
Don't.

329
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:06,053
Thing is,
we don't want people to, you know...

330
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:08,597
- What?
- Panic.

331
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,701
Everybody down!

332
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,746
- [passengers screaming, clamoring]
- Down! Down!

333
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,624
- [hijacker 1] Remain in your seats!
- [hijacker 2] You! Down!

334
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:38,210
Get down! All of you! Get down now!

335
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,506
Do not move!

336
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,050
Sit the fuck down!

337
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,844
Stay in your fucking seats!

338
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,679
Oh, geez. [whimpering]

339
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,056
- [hijacker 1] Do not move!
- [hijacker 2] Stay the fuck down!

340
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,349
[hijacker 1] Don't be fucking stupid!

341
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,392
[passenger] Please!

342
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,353
[hijacker 1 speaking Arabic]

343
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:59,064
[hijacker 2] Stay calm! S-Sit down.
Face the front.

344
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,026
No, you fucking don't.

345
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,780
Everyone stay calm,
and no one gets hurt, okay?

346
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,627
[hip-hop music playing]

347
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,505
Morning.

348
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,508
[breathing heavily]

349
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,469
Kai, do you want some milk?

350
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,098
[Kai breathing heavily]

351
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:40,355
Morning.

352
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,610
[sighs]

353
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,199
Wow.

354
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:55,204
So Detective Daniel gets
to sleep over now.

355
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,455
You don't call him that, Kai.

356
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:59,583
So, what are we?
Are w-- Are we all flatmates now?

357
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,876
We spoke about this.

358
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,545
[inhales deeply] It's okay. I get it.

359
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,132
Great bike, by the way. [inhales sharply]

360
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:10,594
Thanks. I decided to get one
that's fixed onto the floor.

361
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:12,471
Go on.

362
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:15,307
So that you and your mates
can't pull me over for no reason.

363
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,643
That's a good joke. I like it.

364
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,228
- No joke.
- Kai.

365
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,771
And you don't like it.

366
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:32,199
Everybody, listen!
This is how it's gonna work.

367
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,617
[hijacker 2 speaks Arabic]

368
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,619
Nobody makes any noise.

369
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,246
[hijacker 2 speaks Arabic]

370
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,914
Nobody makes any trouble.

371
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,791
[hijacker 2 speaks Arabic]

372
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:45,838
And nobody gets seriously fucking injured.

373
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:47,381
[speaks Arabic]

374
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,551
[passenger 1] Did you hear that?
That's Arabic.

375
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:55,055
- [passenger 2] She's speaking English.
- She is. She's English.

376
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:59,184
[inhales shakily]
But someone is speaking Arabic.

377
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:06,191
Phones, tablets, devices. The Wi-Fi's off.
There's no need to be a hero.

378
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,317
[breathing shakily]

379
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,738
[breathes deeply, exhales shakily]

380
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,366
- Hey. Hey, what's your name?
- [inhales deeply]

381
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,410
- Amanda. Yeah. [inhales deeply]
- Amanda?

382
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,413
- Amanda, just breathe, all right? I'm Sam.
- [breathing shakily]

383
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,665
- Listen to me. Drink that.
- Okay.

384
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,210
- Look, you're like me, yeah?
- Hmm.

385
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,171
Got family? Loved ones?

386
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,465
We got one job to do right now.

387
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:33,260
- Just get through it for them. All right?
- [hijacker] Back in your fucking seat.

388
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,053
[breathing shakily] Yeah.

389
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:44,521
Well, I can't see anything.
Explains why no one's answering.

390
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,691
I'm sure I heard something.
Try calling the other galleys.

391
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:56,700
- [phone ringing]
- [hijacker 2 speaks Arabic]

392
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,329
- [phone continues ringing]
- [speaks Arabic]

393
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:06,126
Oh, come on. What difference does it make?

394
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:14,092
- [cries]
- Oh, mate, it's all right. It's--

395
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,886
[phone ringing]

396
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:21,058
[breathing shakily]
Listen, we've g-- we've got an incident.

397
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:22,309
<i>We've got a major incident--</i>

398
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,228
Wait, wait. Slow down.
I can't hear what you're saying.

399
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:28,148
They've got control of the whole plane.
They've-- [breathing heavily]

400
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,074
[breathing heavily] They've got guns.

401
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,668
Colette Fisher.

402
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:55,676
Dubai, this is Kingdom 2-9.
Dubai, can you hear me?

403
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,678
Kingdom 2-9, you can't keep away.

404
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:01,849
[Robin] Dubai, we have a possible
security incident on board. Stand by.

405
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,769
Whatever's happening out there.
We cannot open that door.

406
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,192
Correction, Dubai. That's a definite
security incident on board.

407
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,570
Definite security incident on board.

408
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,947
We all know the score.

409
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:20,909
If they're Arab or anything like that,
we take 'em on, yeah?

410
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,035
[sighs]

411
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:23,120
We've got no choice.

412
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,538
That's not a good idea.

413
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:30,627
Oh, you wanna let them crash us
into some capital city, is that it?

414
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,921
[Sam] Oh, come on.
Is that what you think's gonna happen?

415
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,464
[scoffs] I have no idea, pal.

416
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,757
No. Obviously.

417
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:38,135
Yeah, but I'm not gonna wait
and find out, am I?

418
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,639
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna just attack him?

419
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,641
No one's asking you to join in.

420
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,185
You'll get yourself killed.

421
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:49,104
Listen, if you've not got the balls,

422
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,816
- all you have to do is say.
- [hijacker] Phones, tablets, devices.

423
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:53,901
Come on.

424
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:56,778
Thank you.

425
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:00,032
[sighs, sniffs] Phone?

426
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:03,243
I-I haven't got it.
Listen, you c-- you can have it.

427
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,787
It's just, it's in my seat,
and this isn't my seat.

428
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,581
She-- She put me in this seat, remember?

429
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,136
[flight attendant breathing heavily]

430
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:34,149
- [passenger 1] Okay, now. Let's go.
- [passenger 2] We're doing this.

431
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,780
Listen. Listen, guys.

432
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:43,784
No one is asking you to make this call.
No one. All right?

433
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:45,994
Just because you speak the loudest

434
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,538
doesn't mean you've got
anything better to say.

435
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:48,830
It doesn't mean
you've thought this through.

436
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,999
- There's nothing to think through.
- No, there is.

437
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,544
You just haven't thought of it yet.
All right?

438
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,713
Look, this plane took off from Dubai,

439
00:29:56,713 --> 00:30:00,467
so there are people on this flight
that only speak Arabic.

440
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,844
So, if you're gonna hijack a plane,

441
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:04,555
- Arabic's a language you need to speak.
- [hijacker, in Arabic] Handheld devices.

442
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:12,521
It doesn't make you a suicide bomber.
It just means you're prepared.

443
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:16,775
Phones. Tablets.

444
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:19,695
Devices.

445
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,614
The Wi-Fi is off...

446
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,910
so no need to be a hero.

447
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:35,419
Until you know who these people are,
do nothing.

448
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:40,507
[grunts]

449
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:45,512
It's not gonna work.

450
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,056
They won't let you in.
Not if something's happening.

451
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,308
That's right.

452
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:51,435
That's the rule.

453
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,770
That's right.
That's why you're gonna convince 'em.

454
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,067
[breathing heavily]

455
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,616
[phone line ringing]

456
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,076
[phone ringing]

457
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,078
Flight deck.

458
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:14,416
<i>Um, they want access to the cockpit.</i>

459
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,211
That's not possible.

460
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:24,134
<i>I know that, but they've got guns, and,
um, they're not-- they're not giving up.</i>

461
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,137
No, we understand that.
We understand that,

462
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:30,098
but that's why we can't open the door.
You know that.

463
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,894
- She's saying no.
- She?

464
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,313
- First officer.
- Talk to the pilot.

465
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:39,233
- He'll say the same thing.
- The pilot. Now.

466
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,153
[sighs]

467
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:45,489
[swallows]

468
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,826
[Colette]
I-- I need to speak to the captain.

469
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:59,044
[breathes deeply]

470
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,883
Captain speaking.

471
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:09,137
<i>They want access to the cockpit.</i>

472
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:12,099
You know we can't do that.

473
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,434
I know that. I've said that.

474
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,856
Talk to him about last night,
about what it meant to you.

475
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:20,732
The Plaza.

476
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,735
How do you know about that?

477
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:28,323
Say it was magical.
Say every trip to Dubai is magical.

478
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,368
- Robin.
- 'Cause you get to be together.

479
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,121
Because you love him.

480
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:36,290
Robin. [sighs]

481
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,499
Tell him you love him.

482
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:39,960
Robbie, they know.

483
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:43,714
Say it!

484
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:46,466
[breathes shakily]

485
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:52,181
[breathes shakily, sighs] Love you.

486
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:55,517
[breathing shakily] I love you. [cries]

487
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,275
I love you too, Colette.

488
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,823
Either he opens that door,
or I pull this trigger.

489
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,201
[whimpers, screams]

490
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:13,827
[whimpering, breathing heavily]

491
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,461
[cries] He's gonna kill me.
Please, just open the door.

492
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,380
He's gonna blow my head off.
Please. [crying]

493
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,439
If it doesn't open, we kill this one
and do another one and so on, yeah?

494
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,613
If they take control of this plane,

495
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,367
they can fly it anywhere,
do anything with it.

496
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:55,452
[clears throat]

497
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:05,420
[Robin breathes shakily]

498
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,509
No. No. You--

499
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,511
- Robin. [breathing shakily]
- I-- [stammers] I don't want to fight you.

500
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:15,681
Don't make me fight you.
I don't want to fight you.

501
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:20,185
- No! [grunting, yelps]
- Anna. Anna, s-- Anna, s-stop!

502
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:25,357
S-Stop. Listen to me. Listen to me.
I'm going to open that door, okay?

503
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:27,317
If you try to stop me, I will hurt you.

504
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,735
You fight me, I will fight you,
and I will win.

505
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:34,199
[inhales sharply] Whatever happens,
whatever you think of me,

506
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,701
I'm opening that door.

507
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:44,668
- No. [groans]
- [grunting]

508
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:46,962
[Robin, Anna, panting, grunting]

509
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:49,255
- [Anna grunting] No! Stop!
- [breathing shakily]

510
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:51,592
[Anna, Robin grunting]

511
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:59,683
Oh, my God. [breathes shakily] Oh, my God.

512
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:04,605
[Colette whimpers]

513
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,525
[breathing heavily]

514
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:14,323
[flight controller]
Kingdom 2-9 is a British A330

515
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:16,074
<i>now entering the Bahraini airspace.</i>

516
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:19,703
We'll have contact with it
for another 20 minutes, maximum.

517
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,873
[Robin]
Dubai, this is Kingdom 2-9. Do you copy?

518
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,709
[flight controller] Kingdom 2-9, go ahead.

519
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:30,255
[Robin] Dubai, I can report
the incident has now been resolved.

520
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:31,798
Resolved?

521
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:36,303
[Robin] That is correct. Uh, I'm happy
to say the entire thing was a false alarm.

522
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,096
<i>We're sorry for any anxiety.</i>

523
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,849
Kingdom 2-9,
you said you had a definite incident.

524
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,103
"Definite security incident on board."
How is that a false alarm?

525
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,735
Uh, it turns out there was a--

526
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:54,279
[stammers]
It was just a couple of drunken passengers

527
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,781
trying to make a sick joke.

528
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:58,909
Uh, we'll be notifying Heathrow
to make sure the police are there

529
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:00,452
<i>to question them on arrival.</i>

530
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,828
We can do that for you.

531
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,414
- Negative, Dubai.
- [flight controller] It's no problem.

532
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,333
[Robin] Uh, thank you, Dubai,

533
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,794
but I think we've wasted enough
of your time already.

534
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,884
In that case,
you're now leaving our airspace.

535
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:18,011
We wish you a safe onward journey.

536
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,014
Kingdom 2-9, copy.

537
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:27,855
Good. Now turn off the Wi-Fi.

538
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:46,373
They said there's no Wi-Fi.

539
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:52,296
If there's no Wi-Fi,
then why take everyone's phones?

540
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,556
[Robin] Um... [sighs]

541
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:08,061
Uh, this is a... [stammers] ...300.
I usually fly the 200s.

542
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:16,987
[Robin] Um...

543
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:19,114
Uh...

544
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:28,749
There.

545
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,384
Here, look.

546
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:46,892
You did that.

547
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,000
[sighs]

548
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,424
[chuckles] You're disappointed?

549
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:24,680
No, I'm, uh... [sighs] ...I'm relieved.

550
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,600
[chuckles] Now you have to do
all the paperwork too.

551
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,436
For the plane that cried wolf.

552
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,196
[breathing deeply]

553
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,834
[breathing heavily]

554
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:03,135
[breathes heavily]

555
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:15,606
[agent] Senil?

556
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:21,486
Gala? Gala?

557
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,366
Senil?

558
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:48,597
[breathes deeply]

559
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:55,979
[music playing, muffled]

560
00:39:57,606 --> 00:40:00,067
It's just gonna take a bit of time.
That's all.

561
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:04,112
Well, you've been saying that for months.
What does he expect?

562
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,159
I'm sorry. Not helpful.

563
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:11,870
You ready for your interview?

564
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:15,123
I think so.

565
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,210
You're gonna be great. It's gonna be fine.

566
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,671
You're gonna have an amazing day.

567
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,442
What is it?

568
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:49,867
[intercom chimes]

569
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,120
[Deevia]
"This is your cabin crew speaking.

570
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:56,665
This flight is now under the complete...
[breathes shakily]

00:40:56,665 --> 00:41:00,043
<i>...and irreversible control
of those who have taken charge.</i>

572
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,381
<i>All means of communication
with the ground has been severed.</i>

573
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:09,052
[stammers] Nobody outside of this aircraft
is aware of any issues on board.

574
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:14,016
<i>The captain and cabin crew have decided</i>

575
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:18,437
<i>full cooperation is the best
and only way forward.</i>

00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:24,818
<i>If you stay calm,</i>

578
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:29,156
<i>stay in your allocated seats,
and do as instructed,</i>

579
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:32,993
<i>there is nothing to stop this flight
continuing exactly as it normally would.</i>

580
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:37,039
Resist, however, and--

581
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:44,922
Resist, however, and not only
will you be severely punished,

582
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:49,968
<i>but so too will other innocent passengers
chosen at random</i>

583
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:52,387
<i>as an example to the rest of the plane."</i>

584
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:56,016
Take it from me.
That's not gonna get you anywhere.

585
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:59,019
<i>"Ladies and gentlemen,
this flight is now six hours from London.</i>

586
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:02,064
{\an8}<i>Six hours and this will all be over."</i>

587
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:08,612
I told him. We spoke about it.
I told him not to get on the plane.

588
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:12,241
Dad wouldn't lie
about something like this.

589
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:18,705
All right. So, he's on a flight
back from Dubai, yeah?

590
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:20,457
You got a flight number?

591
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:21,792
[Kai] No.

592
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:25,045
But Mum will.

593
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:28,799
[Daniel] They'll probably want everything
you have, every detail. Okay?

594
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:31,343
- W-What does the message say?
- Kai.

595
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:32,928
It's important.

596
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,308
Dad says, "I'm flying back.

597
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,811
I need to come back to London
for work meetings."

598
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,604
Mom says, "Stop playing games."

599
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:44,398
Dad says, "I take off at 9:12."

600
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,775
Mom says, "Do not get on that plane."

601
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:51,864
Then, an hour ago, Dad says, "Too late."

602
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:58,871
Then Dad says,
"Incident on board. Serious.

603
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:02,541
But I'll get home. I love you."

604
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,253
"I always will."

605
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:21,643
[sighs]

606
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:24,354
- Get back!
- It's okay.

607
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:27,107
I'm just doing as she said,
going back to my allocated seat.

608
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:28,650
[hijacker] Sit the fuck down!

609
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,862
- Stop! What are you doing?
- [Sam] I'm just getting my phone.

610
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:35,282
Right, I promised you
I'd give you my phone, and here it is.

611
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:42,873
What, you come up here just for that?

612
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,044
And to make you an offer.

613
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:51,256
What exactly does your dad do
for a living?

614
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,302
It's difficult to explain.

615
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:59,932
He gets brought in by big companies.

616
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:02,726
If there's a merger or takeover,
it doesn't matter where,

617
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,895
they bring Sam in
at the end of the process,

618
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:06,438
'cause when it all kicks off...

619
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,317
Sam's the best at handling it.

620
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:11,985
Handling what?

621
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:17,574
The negotiation.

622
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,413
Now-- Now, listen to me, all right?

623
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:26,542
There are, like,
some 200 people on this flight,

624
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,002
and most of them will do
exactly as you say.

625
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,587
- That's right.
- But, let's face it,

626
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:33,257
there are some who will kick off
and who'll cause you problems.

627
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:34,675
- Sit down.
- [Sam] No, no.

628
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:36,635
Let me just tell you where I'm at, okay?

629
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,724
Let me tell you where I'm at with this,
all right?

630
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:47,145
I don't care about any of those people.
I just wanna get home to my family.

631
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:49,481
So here's what I'm gonna do.

632
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:53,819
I'm gonna help you.

633
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:57,698
